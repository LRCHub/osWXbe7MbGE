Original / Romaji LyricsEnglish Translationtattaima hajimete kidzuita
Koi ni ochita no da naa
Nijuuyo jikan kimi kimi kimi
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

I realized just now
I fell in love, didn't I?
24 hours a day just you, you, you
I can't get my mind off you!

Nanka (nanka) itsumo to chigau
Kimi to (futari) gikochinai kaiwa
Masaka (ryouomoi) iya kataomoi
Yabai! shisen acchatta!!!

Somehow you seem different from usual
While having an awkward conversation with you
Could it be mutual love? No, it's one-sided love
Oops! Our eyes met!!!

Nani nani!? kono doki-doki!?
Shikou kairou gucchagucha konsen...
Konna koto hajimete da yo
Netsu demo aru no ka naa

What is this!? Why is my heart pounding!?
My train of thought is all off-track...
This has never happened to me before
Maybe I have a fever?

Kyuuten chokka irasshatta koigokoro
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka
Ba-ba... baka na!? te ga furueru zo
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" nano!?

My love has taken a sudden turn
In no time my face turned burning red
N-no way! My hands are shaking
Is this this so-called "love"?

Ya-ya-yacchatta kaiwa kamimakuri
Kimazui chinmoku ma-mi-mu-me-mo
Kimi no (kimi no) kimochi shiritai yo
Ka-ka-kata kataomoi

I-I managed conversation, but I keep stuttering
Awkward silence *mumble mumble*
I want to know your feelings,
My o-o-one-one-sided love

Mune ga moyamoya suru yo
Shokuyoku sanjuu percent minus...
Nande daro ki ni naru n'da
Ara yada koi kashira

My chest is feeling funny
My appetite minus 30 percent
Why would that be, I wonder
Oh no, could it be love?

Nantonaku ki ni natteta kedo
Otomodachi datta no ni
Yappa yappa
Sou iu koto na no nee
Issen, koechaimasu?

For some reason this has been bugging me for a while
That although we are friends
After all
It's like that, you know?
Where we cross the line of friends?

Bucchake (bucchake)
Taipu de wa nai!
Risou (kanari) takakatta kara
Dakedo (I don't care!)
Kankei nai sa
Chotto maji de suki kamo...

To be frank,
She's not my type!
I put the bar pretty high after all
But I don't care
It doesn't matter
Gosh, maybe I really am in love

Shitten battou dobatto koigokoro
Ikinari sekai ga shangurira
Ma-ma-maji ka!? korya tamaran zo
Mune ga juku-juku shiteru no da

The agony! My love is overflowing
All of a sudden the world is Shangri-la
S-serious? I can't hold this out
My heart is overflowing

Mousou gensou risou ga daibousou
Seigyo dekinai yo dame ningen?
Kimi wa (kimi wa) donna kimochi na no?
Ka-ka-kata kataomoi

Delusions, illusions and ideals run amok
I can't control them! Am I hopeless?
How are YOU feeling?
My o-o-one-one-sided love

Moshi tsukiaeta nara
Nante yobou ka na
Adana toka sabbui ka naa

If we would be dating,
What should I call her?
Would a nickname be too lame?

Hitori de katte ni mousou deeto
Eiga minagara poppukoon 'ssho
Niyakechau!!

On my own I imagine our date
It's gotta be a movie with popcorn!
The idea puts a smile on my face!!

Kyuuten chokka irasshatta koigokoro
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka
Ba-ba... baka na!? te ga furueru zo
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" nano!?

My love has taken a sudden turn
In no time my face turned burning red
N-no way! My hands are shaking
Is this this so-called "love"?

Ya-ya-yacchatta kaiwa kamimakuri
Kimazui chinmoku ma-mi-mu-me-mo
Kimi no (kimi no) kimochi shiritai yo
Ka-ka-kata kataomoi

I-I managed conversation, but I keep stuttering
Awkward silence *mumble mumble*
I want to know your feelings,
My o-o-one one-sided love

Hatsukoi!! itsumo no tsuugakuro
Pika-pika hikaru I DO fall in love!
Sora mo tobesou sa
Ka-ka-kata kataomoi

Puppy love!! The same old road to school
Is shining, I DO fall in love
I feel like I could fly
O-o-one-one-sided love
